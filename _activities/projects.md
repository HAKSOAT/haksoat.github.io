# Page Analyser

> Group Project

Page Analyser is a CLI application built in Python-Argparse, BeautifulSoup, and Scikit-Learn.  

Page Analyser uses machine learning to analyse web pages and classify them into about, contact, privacy, and gallery pages.  

The software was developed during the Hotels NG 5.0 internship where I was a graduate intern.
