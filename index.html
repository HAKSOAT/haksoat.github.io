<p>Hi there, I am <strong>Habeeb Kehinde Shopeju</strong>, a <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/people/habeeb-shopeju/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Engineer</a> at <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a>. I am excited about the development of information retrieval and machine learning systems across different industries. So far I have played with and worked on projects relating to the food, finance, health, legal, media and security industries.</p>

<p>I'd like to think I'm obsessed with learning and trying new things, so this is one of the many spaces where I try to write about such things when I feel like it. I am open to having a chat about anything that intrigues you in my write-ups and activities.</p>

<p>I am quite active on <a href="https://twitter.com/HAKSOAT">Twitter</a> and you can <a href="mailto:shopejuh@gmail.com">send me a mail</a> too. If you are interested in seeing if I am a good fit for a role; <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/haks/image/upload/v1750365195/HabeebShopeju.pdf">my resume</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/habeebshopeju/">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HAKSOAT">Github</a> and technical blog page are places you&#39;d want to look at.</p>
