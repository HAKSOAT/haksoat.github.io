<p>Hi there, I am <strong>Habeeb Kehinde Shopeju</strong>, a Research Engineer in Machine Learning at the <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/careers/our-jobs/join-thomson-reuters-labs.html" target="_blank">Thomson Reuters Labs</a>. I am excited about the development of information retrieval and machine learning systems across different industries, especially relating to education, media, health and food.</p>

<p>I'd like to think I'm obsessed with learning and trying new things, so this is one of the many spaces where I try to write about such things when I feel like it. I am open to having a chat about anything that intrigues you in my write-ups and activities.</p>

<p>I am quite active on <a href="https://twitter.com/HAKSOAT">Twitter</a> and you can <a href="mailto:shopejuh@gmail.com">send me a mail</a> too. If you are interested in seeing if I am a good fit for a role; <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/haks/image/upload/v1604251722/HabeebShopeju.pdf">my resume</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/habeebshopeju/">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HAKSOAT">Github</a> and technical blog page are places you&#39;d want to look at.</p>
