<h1 style="text-align: center;">Habeeb Kehinde Shopeju</h2>

<p>
Sometimes I'm a Software Developer who writes software that processes Digital Signals and Files for the web. 
Other times, I'm a Technical Content Writer who writes tutorials or documentation to help other software developers.

Every time, I'm an ambitious individual who pays attention to details, and is excited about creating stuff.
<p>


<p>
I relish the experience of being part of communities, working as a team and lending a helping hand to others. 
Hence, I currently serve as a core team member of the <a href="https://dscfunaab.club" target="_blank">Developer Student Club FUNAAB</a> and the <a href="https://www.aiabeokuta.com/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Saturdays, Abeokuta</a> study group.
</p>


<p>
I'm always seeking new challenges, and I'd be excited if they come as a Software Engineering internship or a freelance Technical Content Writing gig. 
You can check out my <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/haks/image/upload/v1554856551/HabeebShopeju.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>, or see the <a href="/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> I've worked on.

Are you interested in the kind of content I produce as a Technical Content Writer? Check out my writeups for <a href="https://linuxhint.com/author/kenny/" target="_blank">LinuxHint</a>, and <a href="https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/" target="_blank">Real Python</a>. 
I also <a href="blog">write</a> often on various Software Development and Digital Signal Processing concepts as I get to learn them.
</p>


<p>
<b>Fun Fact:</b> I don't cook a lot, but don't underrate my cooking skills. I'll blow your mind.
