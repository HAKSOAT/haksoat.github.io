<p>Hi there, I am <strong>Habeeb Kehinde Shopeju</strong>, a Software Engineer who builds majorly server-side software. I am also excited about the development of information retrieval systems across different industries, especially relating to education, health and media.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this write-up is to state my &quot;why&quot; for setting up this blog. If you are curious about that, you can read on. However, if you are only interested in hiring me; <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/haks/image/upload/v1604251722/HabeebShopeju.pdf">my resume</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/habeebshopeju/">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HAKSOAT">Github</a> and technical blog page are places you&#39;d want to look at. If you intend to reach out, I am quite active on <a href="https://twitter.com/HAKSOAT">Twitter</a> and you can <a href="mailto:shopejuh@gmail.com">send me a mail</a> too.</p>

<p><i>Back to the discussion...</i></p>

<p>Ever since I started writing software as a hobby, it has always been beyond writing code. There has been a deeper connection, to make the world an easier place to live in through the software that I build. Asides building software, I also look forward to make things easier for others in the various ways I can.</p>

<p>However, I am starting to feel like there has to be more ways to make impact, and writing happens to pop up in my head. Considering I have <a href="https://linuxhint.com/author/kenny/">previous writing experiences</a>, I think I can pick up writing again. This will be my space to share knowledge I have gained, and I will be doing this with the hope of making someone else better.</p>

<p>I also would like to teach at some point, but the reality being that there's no guarantee of life at that point, I may just start through this medium. While I will write technical stuff more often, I may also write on non-technical topics to share my thoughts and experiences.</p>

<p>Truly, there is no avoiding putting out wrong information at some point, but I will always do well to make modifications when I realize places where I err. I do believe that the internet is one of mankind&#39;s greatest inventions, and I am going to try to leave my footprints on it, making impact in my own little way. </p>
