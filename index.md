Hello World,

## Here's what I want:

I'm Habeeb Shopeju, a self-taught software developer currently studying Electrical Electronics Engineering at the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta.

The hunger to learn more, build solutions has kept me coding for more than two years. Hence, I am in search of a software engineering internship opportunity; be it remote or onsite.  

I believe working with other talented engineers can help me improve my craft immensely.

I'm keen on working on projects in the field of Digital Signal Processing. You can checkout [my projects](/projects).

While I wait for the opportunity to come, I need to go get myself prepared.

Thanks,  
Habeeb Shopeju.
